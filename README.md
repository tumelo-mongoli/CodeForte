CodeForte Assessment


As mentioned in the email, I decided to use Katalon studio in attempt to using a tool that does not need a high 
performing machine because my laptop has issues processing operations that are demanding to the CPU. 

I have added all the answers to the assessment questions to the Manual Doc. 

Please see below the guide To Run the Test: 
		- Add Katalon an extension on Chrome 
		- Open Katalon from the extensions icon

		- Navigate to the Autotest folder and select the AutoShoppings.krecorder file
		- The Suite will imported to Katalon Recorder 
		- Open the suite and click on the 3 dots on the Navigate to site 
		- Click the Play from here option
